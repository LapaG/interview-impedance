= Interview task: impedance signal analysis

Simple implentation of impedance cardiography signal analysis.

== Input data

Program expects `csv` filename with header at line `5`, which contains columns with data as described below. 
The rest of columns is ignored.

[options=header]
|====
| Column | Meaning | Notes
// ----------------
| `timestamp`
| Data unix timestamp in milleseconds.
| Current implementation uses start time of `1749475908106` to show plot.
// ----------------
| (any)
| Unused column
| 
// ----------------
| `BIOZI`
|  Real part of impedance data
| 
// ----------------
| `BIOZQ`
| Imaginary part of impedance data
|
|====

== Basic usage

In order to run the program supply the filename parameter, as follows:

[source,shell]
-----
$ ./impedance_plot.py input.csv
-----

To show commandline help use `--help`.

== Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
