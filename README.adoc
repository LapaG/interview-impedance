The rest of columns is ignored.

[options=header]
|====
| Column | Meaning | Notes
// ----------------

| Current implementation uses start time of `1749475908106` to show plot.
// ----------------
| (any)
| Unused column
| 
// ----------------
| `BIOZI`
|  Real part of impedance data
| 
// ----------------
| `BIOZQ`
| Imaginary part of impedance data
